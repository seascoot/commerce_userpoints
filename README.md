# commerce_userpoints
Version of Drupal 7 Module Commerce Userpoints modified for cash credit use

## Introduction ##
This is a hack of the Drupal module called [Commerce Userpoints](http://https://www.drupal.org/project/commerce_userpoints), originally posted by liupascal.

I was looking for something simple to allow me to give store credits to account holders to offset purchases made through checkout.  I tried the 7.x-1.x-dev version posted 2013-Dec-23, but found that it was not usable for the purpose I required.

## Changes ##
